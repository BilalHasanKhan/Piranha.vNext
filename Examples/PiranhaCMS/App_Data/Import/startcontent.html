<p>
	This is a <strong>complete rewrite</strong> of Piranha CMS in order to achieve a more simple, flexible
	and future proof architecture. The framework is database &amp; authentication agnostic with simple provider
	interfaces that makes sure that it can be adapted to different architectures.
</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>

	Piranha CMS is released under the MIT license.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
	This version doesn't in any way have the same set of features as the currently released version of Piranha CMS.
	In order to get the community involved I wanted to release the source code as soon as possible to get as many
	contributors as possible.
