This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS in order to achieve a more simple, flexible and future proof architecture. The framework is database & authentication agnostic with simple provider interfaces that makes sure that it can be adapted to different architectures.

## Licensing

Piranha CMS is released under the **MIT** license.

## Status

This repository is under development and is **not** intended for production use.

## Features

This version doesn't in any way have the same set of features as the currently released version of Piranha CMS. In order to get the community involved I wanted to release the source code as soon as possible to get as many contributors as possible.

## Roadmap

You can find the roadmap under **Milestones** in this repository.

## Contribute

Open Source is based on contributions. If you want to get involved, just **fork the repository** and get started! If you want to contribute more, team members are **more than welcome**!

## Donate

If you like Piranha CMS, and want me to be able to put more time into the project. Feel free to **give me a tip** on [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/tidyui). If not, I still hope you find the project useful!
